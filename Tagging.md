# 🏷️ OCI Tagging Overview

Tagging is a **powerful feature** in OCI that helps you:

- Organize and manage resources
- Track costs
- Control access with policies

---

## 🔑 What is a Tag?

A **tag** is a simple **key-value pair** (e.g., `Environment=Production`) that helps classify and identify resources.

Example:
```text
Key: Environment
Value: Production
```


You can apply **multiple tags** to a resource (check service limits for exact count).

---

## 🎯 Why Use Tags?

1. **Organization**  
   Easily group and manage thousands of OCI resources using meaningful tags.

2. **Cost Management**  
   Track usage and spending based on tags to understand cost per project, department, or environment.

3. **Access Control (Tag-Based IAM)**  
   Create **policies** that grant or restrict access based on resource tags instead of user groups.

## 🧾 Types of Tags in OCI

OCI supports two types of tags:

### 1. 🆓 Free-form Tags

- Format: `Key=Value`  
- No schema enforcement  
- No access control  

Example:
```text
Key: Project
Value: Alpha
```


---

### 2. 📘 Defined Tags

- Stored within a **tag namespace**
- Enforced **schema** and **value types**
- **Policy-controlled** application (who can apply and where)

Example:
```text
Namespace: operations
Key: environment
Value: production
```

> ✅ You can restrict values to dropdowns (e.g., `dev`, `test`, `prod`) and control access via IAM.

---

## 🧱 Tag Structure

```text
<Tag Namespace>.<Tag Key> = <Value>
```

Example:
```text
operations.environment = production
```

- **Namespace**: Container for tag keys (e.g., `operations`)
- **Tag Key**: Name of the tag (e.g., `environment`)
- **Value**: Assigned value (e.g., `production`)

---

## 🚫 Tag Namespace Notes

- **Cannot be deleted** once created
- Can be **retired** (disabled from future use)
- Useful for **audit and governance**

---

## ✅ Summary

- Tags help organize, track, and secure your OCI resources
- Use **free-form** for flexibility and **defined tags** for control
- Leverage **tag-based IAM** for granular access
- Defined tags improve **governance** and **cost visibility**

> 🎯 Use defined tags for mission-critical environments and policy-based automation.
