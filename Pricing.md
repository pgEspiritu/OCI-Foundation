# üßæ OCI Governance and Administration: Pricing Overview

Welcome to this module on **Governance and Administration**. In this lesson, we'll explore **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) pricing**.

## ‚úÖ OCI Pricing Models

- Usage-based billing.
- No upfront commitment or minimum service period.
- Metered billing for most resources.

**üü∞ Equivalent Services:**

- **GCP:** Pay-as-you-go Billing

### 2. **Consumption-Based Pricing**
- Applies to services like **OCI Functions**.
- You are charged only when the function runs.
- Ideal for serverless workloads with intermittent activity.

**üü∞ Equivalent Services:**
- **AWS:** AWS Lambda  
- **GCP:** Cloud Functions

---

### 3. **Annual Universal Credits**
- Prepaid annual commitment.
- Offers significant discounts based on deal size and term.
- Additional usage is charged at PAYG rates.

**üü∞ Equivalent Services:**
- **AWS:** Enterprise Discount Program (EDP)

### 4. **Bring Your Own License (BYOL)**

## üí° Key Pricing Factors

### üîπ Data Transfer
- **Inbound data:** Free (Industry standard)
- **Outbound data:** Up to **10√ó cheaper** than other providers
