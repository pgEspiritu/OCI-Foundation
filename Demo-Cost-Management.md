- Adjust filters to view:
  - Daily/monthly costs
  - Historical trends (e.g., Janâ€“May 2023)

### Example Usage:
- Total monthly spend: `$23`
- Most costs from `Compute` & `Database`
- Compartment breakdown shows:
  - `Networking` â†’ $21 of $23
- Region breakdown:
  - Phoenix â†’ $15
  - Ashburn â†’ $7

### Tag-Based View:
- View costs by **user** or **creator**
- Example: `Sergio` created compute instances consuming most cost
- Save views as custom reports:
  - e.g., **"Tag-Based Report"**
