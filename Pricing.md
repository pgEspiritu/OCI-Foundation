Welcome to this module on **Governance and Administration**. In this lesson, we explore **OCI Pricing**.

## üîπ OCI's Pricing Philosophy

- ‚úÖ **Simple**
- ‚úÖ **Transparent**
- ‚úÖ **Lower** than competitors

---

## üíº Pricing Models

1. **Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG)**
   - Charged only for the **resources consumed**
   - ‚úÖ No upfront commitment
   - ‚úÖ No minimum service period
   - ‚úÖ Usage is **metered**

2. **Consumption-Based Pricing**
   - Example: **Oracle Functions (serverless)**
   - Charged **only when the resource is executed**
   - More granular than PAYG (ideal for event-driven/serverless)

3. **Annual Universal Credits (AUC)**
   - Commit to an **annual pool of credits**
   - üéØ Offers **significant savings**
   - Credits expire after 12 months
   - Overage charged at PAYG rate
   - üí° Discounts vary by **deal size and term**

4. **Bring Your Own License (BYOL)**
   - Reuse existing **on-premises licenses**
   - Reduces overall cloud cost

## üîç Key Pricing Factors

- üìè **Resource Size**  
  Larger instances cost more (based on consumption)

- üîÅ **Data Transfer**  
  A significant part of your bill ‚Äî up to **25% or more**

- üíª **Resource Type**  
  VM vs Bare Metal vs Serverless pricing varies

- üîê **License Model**  
  BYOL pricing differs from fully managed

---

## üåç Global Pricing Consistency

- üí° **Same pricing across all OCI regions**
- No regional pricing variability (unlike many cloud providers)

---

## üì° Data Transfer Costs

- **Intra-region AD-to-AD transfer** = ‚úÖ **Free**
- **Inbound data (to OCI)** = ‚úÖ **Free**
- **Outbound data** = üí∞ **~10x lower** than other providers

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Other clouds may charge for data across availability domains, penalizing high availability.
