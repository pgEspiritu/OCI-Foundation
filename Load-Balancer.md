# 🌐 OCI Load Balancer Service – Summary

## 🔎 Why Use a Load Balancer?
- **High Availability:** Traffic is distributed across multiple backend servers.
- **Scalability:** Easily add more backend servers during high traffic.
- **Resilience:** If one backend fails, traffic is routed to healthy instances.
- **Reverse Proxy Functionality:** Acts as the entry point to your backend services.

## 🧭 Load Balancer Types in OCI

### 1. **HTTP Load Balancer (Layer 7)**
- Understands **HTTP/HTTPS** (Layer 7 of the OSI model).
- Supports advanced features like:
  - **Content-Based Routing**
  - **SSL Termination / Pass-through**
- Deployment Options:
  - **Public** Load Balancer: Exposed to the internet.
  - **Private** Load Balancer: Internal traffic only.
- **Shapes:**
  - **Flexible:** Define min/max bandwidth (10 Mbps – 8 Gbps).
  - **Dynamic:** Predefined sizes (micro, small, medium, large).
- **Use Case:** When you need routing intelligence and Layer 7 features.

### 2. **Network Load Balancer (Layer 3 & 4)**
- Operates at **TCP/UDP/ICMP** levels.
- Supports both **public** and **private** deployment.
- **Ultra low-latency and high-performance**.
- **Use Case:** When speed and performance are more critical than advanced Layer 7 features.
