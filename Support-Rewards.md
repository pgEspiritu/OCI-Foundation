# 💸 Oracle Support Rewards

Oracle Support Rewards is a program that provides **cost savings** to Oracle's **on-premises customers** who also consume **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)** services.

---

## 🎯 What Is It?

- Customers earn **Support Rewards** based on their OCI usage.
- These rewards are **applied as payment** toward **on-premises software update licenses and support**.
- The more you use OCI, the **more you save** on your support costs—potentially reducing them to **zero**.

---

## 💰 How Much Can You Save?

| Customer Type       | Savings Earned per $1 Spent on OCI |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Standard Customers  | $0.25                              |
| ULA Customers       | $0.33 *(ULA = Unlimited License Agreement)* |

---

## 📊 Example Calculation

**Scenario:**

- Monthly On-Premises Tech Support Cost = **$450**
- Monthly OCI Consumption = **$1,000**

| Customer Type  | Support Rewards | New Monthly Support Payment |
|----------------|------------------|------------------------------|
| Standard       | $250             | $200 *(450 - 250)*          |
| ULA Customer   | $330             | $120 *(450 - 330)*          |

> ✅ More OCI consumption = Lower support cost

---

## 🧮 How Is OCI Consumption Calculated?

**Formula:**
```math
Support Rewards = Net Unit Price × Actual Usage (per month)
```


- Applies to almost **all OCI services**:
  - Compute
  - Autonomous Database
  - Object Storage
  - and many more...
